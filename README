File-LockDir version 0.01

This is an object-oriented version of the file-locking recipe in 
the perl Cookbok, version 2. 

In addition to the features that the Cookbook version has, this
version allows you to conditionally disable the "clean up all locks
at termination" code and to check the status of a lock without trying
to get it.
